# Sonar-Rock-Vs-Mine
The RocksVsMine.ipynb file is a Jupyter notebook that contains Python code for analyzing and comparing rock and mine data. Here's a summary of the code:

# Importing necessary libraries: 
The code starts with importing necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn.

# Loading data: 
The code loads two datasets - rock data and mine data - using the pandas read_csv function. The rock data is stored in a variable named rock_data and the mine data is stored in a variable named mine_data.
# Data preprocessing: 
The code performs some data preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, converting data types, and creating new features. For example, the code creates a new feature named is_rock in the mine data to indicate whether a mine is a rock or not.
# Data visualization: 
The code creates several visualizations to compare the rock and mine data. For example, the code creates a scatter plot to compare the size and depth of rocks and mines. The code also creates a histogram to compare the distribution of depths of rocks and mines.
# Statistical analysis: 
The code performs some statistical analysis to compare the rock and mine data. For example, the code calculates the mean and standard deviation of the size and depth of rocks and mines. The code also performs a t-test to determine whether the difference in means is statistically significant.
# Model building: 
The code builds a machine learning model to predict whether a given data point is a rock or a mine. The code uses a logistic regression model and evaluates its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

Overall, the RocksVsMine.ipynb file provides a comprehensive analysis of rock and mine data using Python and various data science libraries. The code is divided into several sections, each of which performs a specific task in the analysis pipeline. The code starts by loading and preprocessing the data, then visualizes the data to gain insights, performs statistical analysis to compare the rock and mine data, and finally builds a machine learning model to predict whether a given data point is a rock or a mine. The code is well-documented and easy to follow, making it a great resource for anyone interested in data analysis and machine learning.
